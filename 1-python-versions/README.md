# Managing Python versions

The Python language continually evolves, adding new features and deprecating old ones. Upgrading can break compatibility if libraries havenâ€™t caught up, so managing multiple Python versions on one system is crucial. This ensures older projects remain stable while you explore the latest advances in the language.

## Goal of the exercise

In this exercise, try to run the python script `app.py`. If you're using the devcontainer provided with this repository, there is no system Python available; you can run `uv run app.py` instead, or use `pyenv` to install a python version. 

What do you observe? The person who wrote the scripts claims it worked perfectly on their machine. How do you explain this?
